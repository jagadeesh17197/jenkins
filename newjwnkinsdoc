Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery 
(CICD)
Introduction
Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java with plugins built for Continuous Integration purpose. 
Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate 
changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously 
deliver your software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.
With Jenkins, organizations can accelerate the software development process through automation. Jenkins 
integrates development life-cycle processes of all kinds, including build, document, test, package, stage, deploy, 
static analysis and much more.
Jenkins achieves Continuous Integration with the help of plugins. Plugins allows the integration of Various 
DevOps stages. If you want to integrate a particular tool, you need to install the plugins for that tool. For example: 
Git, Maven 2 project, Amazon EC2, HTML publisher etc.

1. Installing and Configuring Jenkins
Step 1:
Download JDK, Tomcat & Jenkins.war
Login into instance ---> change to root user ---> update your instance ---> 
change to OPT dir ---> download JDK, Tomcat7 & Jenkins.war
$sudo su root
#cd /
#apt-get update
#cd /opt/
#wget https://jdk1.8………..tar.gz
#wget https://apache-tomcat…….tar.gz
Open your firefox browser → https://jenkins.io/download/
 
#wget http://ftp-chi.osuosl.org/pub/jenkins/war-stable/2.150.2/jenkins.war
Step 2: Setting paths for Java / JDK and tomcat
Unzip JDK and apache-tomcat
#tar -xzf jdk1.8…………...tar.gs ------> for unzip jdk
#tar -xzf apache-tomcat7…...tar.gz ------> for unzip tomcat
#mv jdk1.8…… jdk1.8 ---> for changing name to jdk1.8
#mv apache-tomcat----- tomcat7 ----> for changing name to tomcat7
#vi ~/.profile
# source ~/.profile ---> to update environment variables
# java -version ----> to check java version, for confirmation of installation
Move jenkins.war file from /opt/ to /opt/tomcat7/webapp/
#mv jenkins.war tomcat7/webapps/
#startup.sh -----> to start tomcat server
Copy instance public ip, open browser
 <instance public ip>:8080/jenkins (tomcat runs on 8080 port default)







2. How to Find Home Directory of Jenkins
1. By Default, while Jenkins installation, a dir will be created in login user home dir
2. This jenkins home dir contains -- All Configurations, Plugins, logs, jobs & etc
3. Login to Jenkins ---> Manage Jenkins ---> on top, you can see the home dir
